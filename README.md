# Citrus-SmartScan_AI - CNN-Based Model for Obect Detection and Direct Regression Counting

Intelligent Systems Project at University of Pisa - MSc Computer Engineering

## Overview Description

**Citrus-SmartScan_AI** uses an artificial intelligence model based on Convolutional Neural Networks to analyze the amount of citrus/olive present in a tree through object detection counting the relative amount. This automated solution, to give an example, will give farmers the ability to make a tree-by-tree assessment of the orchard, and thus be able to estimate with some accuracy which areas are the most productive.

The main objective is then to give an estimate of the agricultural yield (e.g., per hectare) to improve harvesting operational efficiency.
